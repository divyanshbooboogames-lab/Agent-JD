"""MCP server exposing the sector database as tools.

This is the protocol boundary the brief asks for. Nothing above this line
imports the database: the agent process holds no SQLite handle, no SQL and no
schema knowledge. It discovers what it can do by calling `list_tools` over MCP
and acts only through `call_tool`. Swapping SQLite for a warehouse, or moving
this server onto another host over streamable HTTP, would not touch the agent.

Run standalone (stdio):

    python -m agentjd.mcp_server.server

The agent launches exactly this command as a subprocess -- see
`agentjd.agent.mcp_client`.

Safety posture: the connection is opened read-only (SQLite `mode=ro`) and every
statement is parameterised, so a tool argument -- including one a model was
talked into producing -- cannot write to or drop anything.
