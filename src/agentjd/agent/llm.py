"""LLM providers.

Two implementations sit behind one interface:

* `AnthropicProvider` -- runs a manual agentic loop against the Messages API.
  A manual loop rather than the SDK's tool runner because the tools are
  discovered over MCP at runtime, and because every round trip is recorded for
  the response's audit trail.

* `DeterministicProvider` -- answers with no LLM at all. It still goes through
  the same MCP tools and the same persona weighting, and composes the result
  from the persona's own answer structure. It exists so the system is runnable
  and reviewable without credentials, and so tests can assert on retrieval
  behaviour without paying for or depending on model output.

Both return the same `AgentAnswer`, and the response always names which one ran.
