"""Turning provider failures into something a person can act on.

An unhandled provider error reaches the UI as a raw exception repr -- a wall of
nested dicts in which the one useful sentence is buried. Worse, the failures
that actually happen in practice are all operational (no credit, expired key,
rate limit, a model the account cannot reach) and every one of them has a
specific remedy the user could apply in under a minute.

So each is classified once, here, and both interfaces render the same
diagnosis: what happened, and what to do about it.
